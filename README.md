# Tensor Network Born Machines
## Measurement-Driven Generative Model for Quantum Data

Quantum generative models leverage the probabilistic structure of quantum mechan-
ics to learn and reproduce complex data distributions beyond classical capabilities.
Among these, Born machines encode probabilities via quantum amplitudes, offering
efficient sampling and expressive power. However, their scalability is hindered
by issues such as barren plateaus. In this thesis, we investigate Tensor Network
Born Machines (TNBMs), which integrate tensor networks into the Born machine
framework to overcome training obstacles while retaining expressive power. We
examine their theoretical underpinnings and practical implementation for learning
quantum data distributions
