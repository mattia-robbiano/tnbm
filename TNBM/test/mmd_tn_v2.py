keep in mind that [0,1] means measuring |0> and |1> on the two qubits. The elements of computational basis
can be represented by vectors (0,1) and (1,0) respectively.
The training set is represented by an MPO. Each node represent all the qubit measurement as a matrix.
Each row of the matrix is single mesurements of the qubit in computational basis (0,1) or (1,0)
We will have as many rows as the number of data points in the training set.

In our example we will have 2 tensors, each with 4 rows and 2 columns.
